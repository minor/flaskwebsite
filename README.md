Hey, there! This was a flask website designed/created by [@crearo](https://github.com/crearo) that I utilized in the past. I thought the terminal design and the usage of Typed.js looked fascinating so I gave it a shot by myself, though I didn't really change much. I took inspiration from this design and ended up switching stacks to Next.js to create: [https://saurish.com](https://saurish.com/) (my current portfolio).
